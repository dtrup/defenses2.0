# Thematic Analysis: Cross-Chapter Consistency Review

Analyze how themes, concepts, and narrative threads develop across your book.

## Your Task

1. **Read all available content**:
   - @TOC.md - planned structure and themes
   - @BOOK_SUMMARY.md - current progress
   - All completed chapters in chapters/
   - All brainstorms in brainstorms/
   - @style-guide.md for thematic guidance

2. **Identify recurring themes**:
   - What concepts appear in multiple chapters?
   - How do key ideas evolve and deepen throughout the book?
   - Are there unintentional contradictions or inconsistencies?
   - Which examples or case studies are referenced multiple times?

3. **Map narrative threads**:
   - **Thread 1**: [Name and describe] - appears in chapters [X, Y, Z]
   - **Thread 2**: [Name and describe] - develops from chapter [A] to [B] 
   - **Thread 3**: [Name and describe] - culminates in chapter [C]

4. **Consistency analysis**:
   - **Terminology**: Are key terms defined and used consistently?
   - **Examples**: Do recurring examples stay consistent in details?
   - **Voice**: Does the authorial voice remain steady across chapters?
   - **Arguments**: Do later chapters build logically on earlier foundations?

5. **Identify opportunities**:
   - **Strengthen weak threads**: Which themes need more development?
   - **Add connections**: What cross-references could be added?
   - **Resolve contradictions**: Any conflicting claims to reconcile?
   - **Enhance flow**: How could chapter transitions be improved?

6. **Update BOOK_SUMMARY.md** with thematic insights:
   - Document major thematic threads
   - Note consistency issues found
   - Record improvement opportunities

Provide actionable insights for strengthening the book's overall coherence.
