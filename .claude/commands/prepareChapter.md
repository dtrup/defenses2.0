# Brainstorm & Research Plan for Chapter $1

Create a comprehensive brainstorm that will guide the chapter writing process.

## Your Task

1. **Read project context**:
   - @TOC.md - understand this chapter's role in overall structure
   - @BOOK_SUMMARY.md - see progress and thematic threads so far  
   - @style-guide.md - internalize the voice and approach
   - @book.config.json - chapter targets and style preferences
   - @chapters/chapter-$1.md - existing chapter content to build upon
   - Previous chapters for voice consistency and continuity

2. **Research phase** (if needed):
   - Identify key facts, studies, or sources needed
   - Look up any unfamiliar concepts or recent developments
   - Note authoritative sources and quotable experts

3. **Create comprehensive brainstorm** in `brainstorms/chapter-$1-brainstorm.md`:
   - **Existing content assessment**: What's already drafted and what needs work?
   - **Core thesis**: What's the ONE key insight this chapter delivers?
   - **Narrative hook**: How does it open compellingly?
   - **Key examples**: 3-5 specific stories/cases that illustrate the points
   - **Chapter arc**: How does it flow from opening to conclusion?
   - **Connections**: Links to previous chapters and setup for next ones
   - **Enhancement plan**: How to build on existing content
   - **Research notes**: Sources needed, facts to verify, experts to reference
   - **Potential problems**: What could go wrong and how to avoid it

4. **Update progress**:
   - Mark chapter as "Brainstormed" in @chapters/chapter-$1.md
   - Update @BOOK_SUMMARY.md with brainstorm completion
   - Note any research dependencies or timeline impacts

The brainstorm should be so thorough that writing becomes straightforward execution.
