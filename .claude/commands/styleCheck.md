# Style Check for Chapter $1

Analyze chapter for voice consistency, style adherence, and quality issues.

## Your Task

1. **Read for analysis**:
   - @chapters/chapter-$1.md - the chapter to review
   - @style-guide.md - established style principles
   - @book.config.json - style preferences
   - 1-2 other completed chapters for voice comparison

2. **Style consistency analysis**:
   - **Voice & Tone**: Does it match the established voice? Any jarring shifts?
   - **Pacing**: Good mix of sentence lengths? Varied paragraph structure?
   - **Terminology**: Consistent with terms used in other chapters?
   - **Examples**: Do they fit the book's overall approach and quality level?
   - **Transitions**: Smooth flow between sections and into/out of chapter?

3. **Quality assessment**:
   - **Clarity**: Any confusing or unnecessarily complex passages?
   - **Engagement**: Does it maintain reader interest throughout?
   - **Precision**: Are claims specific and well-supported?
   - **Redundancy**: Any repetitive content or ideas?
   - **Structure**: Does the chapter arc work effectively?

4. **Identify specific issues**:
   - Mark problematic passages with [REVISE: reason]
   - Note style inconsistencies with [STYLE: issue]
   - Flag unclear content with [CLARIFY: what needs explanation]
   - Mark potential cuts with [CUT: why this could be removed]

5. **Provide improvement recommendations**:
   - Prioritize the most important issues
   - Suggest specific fixes for style problems
   - Recommend structural improvements if needed
   - Note what's working particularly well

Focus on making this chapter shine while maintaining consistency with the overall book.
