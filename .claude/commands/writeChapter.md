# Write Chapter $1: Transform Brainstorm into Polished Content

Write the complete chapter using your brainstorm as the roadmap.

## Your Task

1. **Absorb the foundation**:
   - @brainstorms/chapter-$1-brainstorm.md - your detailed plan and research
   - @style-guide.md - voice, tone, and writing principles
   - @book.config.json - targets and style preferences
   - @chapters/chapter-$1.md - existing chapter content to build upon and enhance
   - @CHAPTER_SUMMARIES.md - summaries with major sections of all completed chapters for continuity and navigation
   - Read the immediately previous chapter (chapter-$(($1-1)).md) for direct continuity
   - Read 1-2 other recent completed chapters to maintain voice consistency

2. **Execute the writing plan**:
   - **Build on existing**: Enhance and expand the existing chapter content
   - **Open with impact**: Use the hook from your brainstorm
   - **Follow your arc**: Implement the narrative structure you planned  
   - **Deploy examples**: Use the specific stories/cases you researched
   - **Maintain voice**: Stay consistent with established tone and style
   - **Hit targets**: Aim for the word count in book.config.json
   - **Connect chapters**: Reference previous content using CHAPTER_SUMMARIES.md and set up next chapter
   - **Include research**: Weave in sources and citations naturally

3. **Quality standards**:
   - Every paragraph should advance the argument
   - Examples should illuminate, not just decorate
   - Transitions should be smooth and logical
   - Voice should be consistent with previous chapters
   - Claims should be supported with evidence from brainstorm research

4. **Structure for navigation**:
   - Use clear, descriptive ## headings for major sections
   - Consider logical groupings that will work well in navigation
   - Plan section flow that makes sense both linearly and as jump-to reference

5. **Update tracking**:
   - Update chapter status to "✍️ Drafted" 
   - Add actual word count and completion date
   - Update @BOOK_SUMMARY.md with progress

Write with confidence - your brainstorm did the hard thinking work. Structure your sections clearly so they'll work well with the navigation system added during completion.
