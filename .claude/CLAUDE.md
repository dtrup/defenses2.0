# Book-Base: LLM Writing System

You are working with a **book writing template** designed for LLM-assisted authoring.

## Core Workflow Commands

The user will likely use these commands in sequence:

1. **`/setupBook`** - Customize the forked template for their specific book
2. **`/tocToChapters`** - Generate chapter files from their TOC
3. **`/prepareChapter N`** - Brainstorm and research planning for chapter N
4. **`/writeChapter N`** - Write complete chapter content
5. **`/styleCheck N`** - Review chapter quality and consistency  
6. **`/completeChapter N`** - Finalize and mark chapter complete

## Project Management Commands

- **`/bookStatus`** - Progress dashboard and project health
- **`/thematicAnalysis`** - Cross-chapter consistency review
- **`/findGaps`** - Identify weak areas or missing content
- **`/revisionSweep`** - Systematic improvement pass
- **`/finalReview`** - Publication readiness assessment

## Key Files to Reference

- **`@book.config.json`** - Project settings and targets
- **`@TOC.md`** - Chapter structure and book outline
- **`@style-guide.md`** - Voice, tone, and writing standards
- **`@BOOK_SUMMARY.md`** - Progress tracking and dashboard

- **`@brainstorms/chapter-NN-brainstorm.md`** - Chapter planning and research

## Quality Focus

This system emphasizes:
- **Consistent voice and style** across all chapters
- **Progressive development** through brainstorm ’ write ’ review cycle  
- **Research integration** during the planning phase
- **Professional structure** with proper cross-references and flow

When executing commands, prioritize quality and consistency over speed. The goal is publication-ready content that maintains professional standards throughout.
