## Chapter 00: The Cut That Teaches (Introduction)
**Status**: ✅ Complete | **Word Count**: 924 | **Completed**: 2025-08-29

**Summary**: Sets up the book's central thesis through a personal anecdote about a childhood cut that healed perfectly. Establishes that defense and healing patterns across scales are not metaphors but genuine mechanistic similarities arising from shared constraints. Introduces the concept that living systems use similar "grammar of resilience" from molecular to societal levels.

**Key Themes**: Pattern recognition, mechanistic similarity, cross-scale transfer, resilience grammar

**Transitions**: Sets up expectation for rigorous pattern mapping in subsequent chapters.
