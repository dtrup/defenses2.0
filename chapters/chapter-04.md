## The Pattern Discovery Pipeline

Our methodology for identifying and validating cross-scale patterns follows a rigorous pipeline:

### 1. Pattern Harvesting
Start with observed phenomena across multiple domains:
- Biological: immune responses, wound healing, ecosystem recovery
- Psychological: trauma processing, habit formation, resilience building
- Organizational: crisis management, incident response, institutional learning
- Societal: public health measures, conflict resolution, cultural adaptation

Look for functional similarities, not surface resemblance. When multiple domains solve similar problems with similar mechanisms, we have a candidate pattern.

### 2. Mechanistic Analysis
For each candidate pattern, identify:

**Core Mechanism**: The fundamental dynamics
- What information flows?
- What feedback loops operate?
- What constraints apply?
- What energies/resources are required?

**Causal Structure**: The chain of effects
- What triggers the pattern?
- What intermediate steps occur?
- What determines the outcome?
- What side effects emerge?

**Mathematical Framework**: Where applicable
- Differential equations for dynamics
- Network theory for connectivity
- Information theory for communication
- Control theory for regulation

### 3. Boundary Mapping
Every pattern has limits. We must identify:

**Operating Conditions**: When the pattern works
- Scale ranges (spatial, temporal, organizational)
- Resource requirements
- Environmental prerequisites
- Structural requirements

**Failure Modes**: When and how the pattern breaks
- Overload conditions
- Resource depletion
- Environmental mismatches
- Structural inadequacies

**Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions
- Minimum viable implementations
- Maximum sustainable scales
- Phase transitions
- Catastrophic thresholds

### 4. Cross-Domain Validation
Test whether patterns truly transfer:

**Natural Experiments**: Find existing examples
- Historical cases
- Cross-cultural comparisons
- Organizational variations
- Natural variations

**Controlled Studies**: Where possible
- Laboratory models
- Simulation studies
- Pilot implementations
- A/B testing

**Failure Analysis**: Learn from breakdowns
- Why did transfers fail?
- What assumptions were violated?
- What mechanisms were missing?
- What new patterns emerged?

## Quality Criteria

### Mechanistic Grounding
Every pattern must have clear, describable mechanisms. Not "organizations are like organisms" but "both use negative feedback loops to maintain critical variables within bounds, implemented through sensor-comparator-effector circuits with characteristic delays and gains."

Requirements:
- Identify specific information flows
- Map concrete feedback structures
- Specify energy/resource requirements
- Define measurable variables

Red flags:
- Purely metaphorical language
- No testable mechanisms
- Magical thinking
- Untraceable causality

### Falsifiability
Each pattern must make predictions that could be wrong. A pattern that explains everything explains nothing.

Strong patterns predict:
- Specific failure conditions
- Characteristic error signatures
- Phase transitions
- Scaling relationships

Example: "Early warning systems fail when threat propagation speed exceeds signal propagation speed" - testable across domains from disease spread to market crashes.

### Predictive Power
Patterns should predict novel phenomena, not just explain existing observations.

Test by:
- Making specific predictions before observation
- Identifying consistent signatures across domains
- Predicting interaction effects
- Forecasting failure modes

Example: If containment follows similar dynamics across scales, we predict:
- Initial overreaction followed by calibration
- Leakage proportional to boundary surface area
- Resource costs scaling with containment duration
- Characteristic scarring patterns from prolonged containment

### Practical Utility
Patterns should enable better interventions.

Utility metrics:
- Improved outcome measures
- Reduced resource requirements
- Faster response times
- Fewer unintended consequences

Documentation requirements:
- Clear implementation guidance
- Specific success metrics
- Resource requirement estimates
- Risk assessment protocols

## Transfer Heuristics

### The Transfer Checklist

Before applying a pattern from domain A to domain B:

**1. Mechanism Match**
□ Core dynamics present in both domains?
□ Similar feedback structures?
□ Comparable time constants?
□ Analogous constraints?

**2. Scale Compatibility**
□ Spatial scales align (or transform predictably)?
□ Temporal scales align (or transform predictably)?
□ Organizational scales align?
□ Energy/resource scales realistic?

**3. Context Alignment**
□ Required infrastructure available?
□ Necessary diversity present?
□ Authority structures compatible?
□ Incentives properly aligned?

**4. Risk Assessment**
□ Failure modes identified?
□ Reversibility understood?
□ Collateral damage estimated?
□ Monitoring systems ready?

### Transfer Confidence Levels

**High Confidence**: Direct mechanism match
- Same physics/chemistry
- Similar network topology
- Proven track record
- Multiple successful examples

Example: Compartmentalization from fire safety to computer security

**Medium Confidence**: Analogous mechanisms
- Similar mathematics
- Comparable constraints
- Some successful examples
- Clear boundary conditions

Example: Triage from emergency medicine to project management

**Low Confidence**: Conceptual similarity
- Shared abstract patterns
- Different implementations
- Limited examples
- Many unknowns

Example: Immune memory to organizational learning

**Do Not Transfer**: Fundamental mismatches
- Different causality
- Incompatible timescales
- Opposing constraints
- Ethical conflicts

Example: Cellular apoptosis to social systems

## Evidence Hierarchy

Not all evidence is equal. We maintain a hierarchy:

### Level 1: Proven Mechanisms
- Mathematical proofs
- Physical laws
- Repeatedly verified causality
- Cross-domain validation

### Level 2: Strong Empirical Support
- Multiple independent confirmations
- Controlled experiments
- Clear natural experiments
- Quantitative predictions confirmed

### Level 3: Consistent Observations
- Pattern holds across multiple cases
- Plausible mechanisms
- Some predictive success
- Limited counter-examples

### Level 4: Promising Hypotheses
- Theoretical plausibility
- Initial observations supportive
- Testable predictions made
- Awaiting validation

### Level 5: Speculative Extensions
- Logical extrapolations
- Untested predictions
- Interesting possibilities
- Research directions

## Documentation Standards

Each pattern requires:

### Core Documentation
- **Definition**: One-sentence description
- **Mechanism**: How it works (paragraph)
- **Examples**: 3-5 instances across scales
- **Trade-offs**: Key tensions and costs
- **Metrics**: How to measure success/failure

### Validation Documentation
- **Evidence level**: 1-5 hierarchy rating
- **Supporting studies**: Key citations
- **Counter-evidence**: Known failures or limitations
- **Open questions**: What we don't know

### Implementation Documentation
- **Prerequisites**: What must be in place
- **Process**: Step-by-step implementation

## Living Framework

This framework evolves. We maintain:

### Update Protocols
- Annual review of patterns
- Integration of new evidence
- Retirement of failed patterns
- Addition of emerging patterns

### Version Control
- Track pattern evolution
- Document decision rationale
- Maintain deprecation schedules
- Preserve historical versions

### Community Contribution
- Submission standards
- Peer review process
- Validation requirements
- Attribution protocols

### Negative Results
Equal attention to what doesn't work:
- Failed transfers documented
- Assumptions that proved wrong
- Patterns that seemed promising but weren't
- Lessons learned from failures
