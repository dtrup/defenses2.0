# CHAPTER 25: Error Detection & Repair

## Definition & Intent
Identify deviations from correct state and restore proper function before errors propagate or compound, maintaining system integrity through continuous quality control.

## üåì Polarity
**Vigilance ‚Üî Tolerance**: Aggressive error detection catches problems early but may overcorrect; tolerance reduces false positives but allows error accumulation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Mechanisms Across Levels

### Molecular & Cellular
DNA replication achieves stunning accuracy:
- **Proofreading**: DNA polymerase checks each added base
- **Mismatch repair**: Catches errors missed by proofreading
- **Nucleotide excision repair**: Removes damaged sections
- **Checkpoint proteins**: Halt cell division if DNA damaged
- **Apoptosis**: Cells self-destruct if repair fails

Error rate: 1 in 10 billion base pairs after all corrections.

### Cognitive
The brain constantly detects and corrects errors:
- **Prediction error**: Mismatches between expected and actual
- **Error-related negativity**: Brain signal 100ms after mistakes
- **Cognitive dissonance**: Discomfort from conflicting information
- **Metacognition**: Thinking about thinking to catch errors
- **Reality testing**: Comparing internal models with external data

Learning fundamentally depends on error detection and correction.

### Organizational
Organizations implement multiple error detection layers:
- **Quality assurance**: Testing before release
- **Code review**: Peer examination of changes
- **Financial audits**: Independent verification
- **Performance reviews**: Regular feedback cycles
- **Post-mortems**: Learning from failures

High-reliability organizations obsess over error detection.

### Societal
Societies create error-correcting institutions:
- **Judicial appeals**: Multi-level review of decisions
- **Scientific peer review**: Verification before publication
- **Democratic elections**: Correcting political errors
- **Free press**: Exposing and correcting misinformation
- **Regulatory oversight**: Monitoring compliance

These systems balance error correction with stability.

## Forces & Trade-offs

**Detection sensitivity**: More sensitive detection finds more errors but more false positives
**Correction speed**: Fast fixes may introduce new errors
**Correction cost**: Some errors cheaper to live with than fix
**System disruption**: Correction may require stopping operation
**Error tolerance**: Some redundancy allows function despite errors

## üìà Signals & Metrics

### Health Indicators
- Low error escape rate
- Quick detection to correction time
- Learning from error patterns
- Proportionate response to error severity
- Error rate trending down

### Warning Signs
- Rising error rates
- Same errors repeating
- Detection-correction lag increasing
- Correction creating new errors
- Error fatigue setting in

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Error rate**: Errors / Operations
- **Detection rate**: Detected errors / Total errors
- **Mean time to detection**: Error occurrence to discovery
- **Mean time to repair**: Detection to resolution
- **Correction effectiveness**: Successful fixes / Total attempts

## üß™ Failure Modes

### Over-correction
- Autoimmune disease from excessive immune surveillance
- Perfectionism paralyzing action
- Over-engineering slowing development
- Regulatory burden stifling innovation
- Cancel culture destroying discourse

### Under-detection
- Cancer growing undetected
- Cognitive biases unchecked
- Quality problems reaching customers
- Corruption spreading unseen
- Systemic risks accumulating

### Error Cascade
- DNA repair deficiency causing cancer
- Small mistakes compounding into disasters
- Technical debt overwhelming systems
- Cover-ups worse than original errors
- Financial crises from accumulated risks

## üîÅ Transfer Heuristics

### Do Transfer When:
- Errors have clear signatures
- Detection cost less than error cost
- Repair mechanisms available
- Learning from errors possible
- Error patterns are stable

### Don't Transfer When:
- Error definition unclear
- Detection would cause more harm
- No repair mechanism exists
- Errors are feature not bug
- System depends on variation

### Adaptation Requirements:
- Define what constitutes error
- Build detection mechanisms
- Create repair protocols
- Track error patterns
- Design learning loops

## Practical Applications

### Medical Context
Surgical safety checklists:
- **Problem**: Preventable surgical errors
- **Solution**: WHO Surgical Safety Checklist
- **Components**: Pre-op, time-out, post-op checks
- **Result**: 36% reduction in complications
- **Key**: Simple, systematic error prevention

### Software Context
Test-driven development:
- **Write tests first**: Define correct behavior
- **Code until tests pass**: Implement functionality
- **Refactor**: Improve without breaking tests
- **Continuous integration**: Automated error detection
- **Result**: Fewer bugs, easier maintenance

### Aviation Context
Crew resource management:
- **Problem**: Human error in accidents
- **Solution**: Systematic error detection training
- **Components**: Communication, decision-making, error trapping
- **Culture**: Reporting errors without punishment
- **Result**: Dramatic safety improvements

## Case Studies

### Success: Wikipedia Error Correction
- Millions of editors detecting errors
- Version history allows rollback
- Discussion pages for disputes
- Bots catching common errors
- Result: Accuracy rivaling traditional encyclopedias

### Failure: Theranos Laboratory Testing
- No external quality control
- Suppressed internal error reports
- Modified devices without validation
- Hidden error rates from regulators
- Result: Patient harm and company collapse

### Evolution: Scientific Method
- Ancient: Arguments from authority
- Scientific revolution: Empirical testing
- Modern: Peer review and replication
- Crisis: Replication crisis revealing systematic errors
- Future: Open science and pre-registration

## Pattern Interactions

Error Detection works with:
- **Sentinel**: Early warning of errors
- **Feedback**: Error signals drive correction
- **Memory**: Learning from past errors
- **Redundancy**: Multiple detection mechanisms
- **Cleanup**: Removing error debris

## üß∞ Practice Prompt

Design an error detection system:
1. What errors most damage your system?
2. How would you detect them early?
3. What's the current detection rate?
4. How quickly can you correct?
5. What errors keep repeating?
6. Create one new detection mechanism
7. How will you know it's working?

Remember: Every system makes errors. Great systems detect and correct them quickly.
