# Chapter 11: Triage & Prioritized Repair

> **Target**: 6,000 words | **Status**: Drafted | **Last Updated**: 2025-08-29

## Definition & Intent
Systematic allocation of limited repair resources to maximize overall system survival and function, explicitly choosing what to save, what to delay, and what to sacrifice.

## üåì Polarity
**Efficiency ‚Üî Equity**: Maximizing lives saved may mean abandoning some; treating all equally may save fewer overall. No allocation scheme escapes moral weight.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Mechanisms Across Levels

### Cellular & Tissue
Biology constantly performs triage:
- **Protein quality control**: Misfolded proteins marked for degradation vs repair
- **DNA damage response**: Critical genes repaired first
- **Wound healing priority**: Restore barrier function before cosmetics
- **Metabolic triage**: Vitamins allocated to survival over longevity
- **Apoptosis decisions**: Cells too damaged eliminated

The body ruthlessly prioritizes survival-critical functions, letting non-essential systems degrade when resources are scarce.

### Medical Systems
Emergency medicine formalizes triage:
- **START protocol**: Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment
- **Categories**: Immediate, delayed, walking wounded, deceased/expectant
- **Resource allocation**: Ventilators, ICU beds, organs for transplant
- **Disaster medicine**: Greatest good for greatest number
- **Battlefield medicine**: Different ethics than civilian

COVID-19 made these decisions starkly visible‚Äîwho gets the last ventilator?

### Psychological
The mind triages constantly:
- **Attention allocation**: What gets conscious processing
- **Memory consolidation**: What gets stored long-term
- **Emotional processing**: Which feelings get examined
- **Trauma response**: What gets integrated vs dissociated
- **Cognitive load**: What gets simplified or ignored

Therapy often involves re-triaging‚Äîattending to previously ignored wounds.

### Organizational
Organizations face resource allocation decisions:
- **Project portfolios**: Which initiatives get funding
- **Incident response**: Which systems restored first
- **Customer service**: Which complaints get priority
- **Technical debt**: What gets fixed vs lived with
- **Talent allocation**: Best people on hardest problems

The challenge is balancing urgent vs important, critical vs valuable.

### Societal
Societies make large-scale triage decisions:
- **Healthcare rationing**: Coverage decisions, waiting lists
- **Infrastructure repair**: Which bridges fixed first
- **Disaster response**: Which areas get aid first
- **Economic bailouts**: Which industries saved
- **Climate adaptation**: Which communities protected

These decisions reflect values and power structures as much as rational calculation.

## Forces & Trade-offs

**Speed vs. Accuracy**: Quick triage may misclassify; careful assessment takes precious time
**Individual vs. Population**: Saving one may cost many; abandoning one may save many
**Present vs. Future**: Emergency response vs. building resilience
**Visible vs. Hidden**: Dramatic problems vs. quiet suffering
**Reversible vs. Permanent**: Can decisions be changed as resources arrive?

## üìà Signals & Metrics

### Health Indicators
- Resources reaching highest-impact uses
- Clear, consistent criteria applied
- Regular reassessment as conditions change
- Acceptable outcomes given constraints
- Learning improving future triage

### Warning Signs
- Resources wasted on unsalvageable cases
- Critical needs missed in assessment
- Inconsistent or biased allocation
- No mechanism for reassessment
- Moral injury in decision makers

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Lives/QALYs saved per resource unit**
- **System functionality preserved**
- **Time to critical function restoration**
- **Accuracy of initial classification**
- **Equity measures across groups**

## üß™ Failure Modes

### Over-triage (Resource Waste)
- Too many classified as critical
- Resources exhausted on marginal cases
- System collapse from overextension
- Preventable deaths from resource depletion

### Under-triage (Missed Opportunities)
- Salvageable cases abandoned
- Resources underutilized
- Excess capacity while needs unmet
- System capability not fully deployed

### Mis-triage (Wrong Priorities)
- Wrong assessment of criticality
- Bias affecting decisions
- Political rather than medical criteria
- Short-term over long-term thinking

## üîÅ Transfer Heuristics

### Do Transfer When:
- Resources genuinely scarce
- Clear criteria can be defined
- Outcomes measurably different
- Decision makers have authority
- Reassessment possible

### Don't Transfer When:
- Adequate resources available
- No legitimate criteria exist
- Would violate fundamental rights
- Decision makers lack expertise
- No accountability mechanisms

### Adaptation Requirements:
- Define clear categories
- Train decision makers
- Create appeals process
- Monitor outcomes
- Adjust criteria based on results

## Practical Applications

### Hospital Context
Emergency department flow:
- **Assessment**: Vital signs, chief complaint, acuity
- **Categories**: ESI levels 1-5
- **Resources**: Beds, staff, equipment
- **Reassessment**: Waiting patients rechecked
- **Metrics**: Left without being seen, time to treatment

### Business Context
Product development priorities:
- **Assessment**: Market impact, technical feasibility, resource needs
- **Categories**: Must have, should have, nice to have
- **Resources**: Engineering time, budget
- **Reassessment**: Sprint planning, quarterly reviews
- **Metrics**: Feature delivery, customer satisfaction

### Environmental Context
Conservation triage:
- **Assessment**: Species endangerment, ecological role, save-ability
- **Categories**: Priority, maintain, monitor, triage out
- **Resources**: Funding, expertise, habitat
- **Reassessment**: Population monitoring
- **Metrics**: Species saved, ecosystem function

## Case Studies

### Success: London Emergency Response 7/7 Bombings
- Clear triage protocols activated
- Hospitals cleared elective cases
- Color-coded patient tracking
- Regular reassessment
- Result: No preventable deaths after reaching hospital

### Failure: Hurricane Katrina Hospital Decisions
- Overwhelmed systems
- No clear protocols
- Controversial end-of-life decisions
- Criminal charges filed
- Result: Moral injury, legal consequences, system reform

### Innovation: Organ Allocation Systems
- Complex scoring algorithms
- Geographic and medical factors
- Regular refinement
- Transparent process
- Result: More equitable distribution but ongoing tensions

## Pattern Interactions

Triage connects with:
- **Recognition**: Must classify correctly
- **Sentinel**: Provides early warning for triage
- **Containment**: May triage containment efforts
- **Memory**: Past triage informs future
- **Sacrifice**: Ultimate triage decision

## üß∞ Practice Prompt

Apply triage thinking to a resource constraint:
1. What resource is truly limited?
2. What needs that resource?
3. How would you categorize needs?
4. What criteria would you use?
5. Who would make decisions?
6. How would you handle disagreement?
7. How would you know if it worked?

Hard truth: Not everything can be saved. The question is how to decide.
