# CHAPTER 30: Designing Interventions: Playbooks for Therapy, Policy, and Organizations

## From Pattern to Practice

Understanding patterns is one thing; implementing them is another. This chapter translates abstract patterns into concrete intervention protocols for three critical domains: therapy, policy, and organizations. Each playbook includes guardrails to prevent misuse and metrics to track effectiveness.

## Therapeutic Interventions Playbook

### The Container Protocol (for Trauma Processing)

**Pattern Foundation**: Containment + Boundary + Narrative

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Establish Safety Container** (Session 1-3)
   - Define therapy boundaries (time, space, confidentiality)
   - Create internal safe space visualization
   - Develop affect regulation skills
   - Install "pause" mechanism for overwhelm

2. **Titrated Exposure** (Session 4-12)
   - Open container briefly (5-10 minutes)
   - Process small amount of material
   - Re-seal container explicitly
   - Integration work between openings

3. **Narrative Construction** (Session 13-20)
   - Connect fragments into coherent story
   - Identify meaning and growth
   - Integrate into life narrative
   - Plan future with new understanding

**Guardrails**:
- Never open more than client can process
- Always close container before session ends
- Monitor dissociation and flooding
- Have emergency protocol ready

**Metrics**:
- SUDS (Subjective Units of Distress) ratings
