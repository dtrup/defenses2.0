## Voice & Tone

### Core Voice
- **Authority Level**: Expert - Drawing from deep knowledge while remaining accessible
- **Formality**: Professional-Conversational - Serious topics with engaging delivery
- **Personality**: Warm-Direct - Caring about outcomes, clear about mechanisms

### Tone Characteristics  
- **Engagement Style**: Analytical-Narrative - Lead with concrete examples, explain patterns
- **Humor**: Warm - Occasional light moments to humanize complex topics
- **Technical Approach**: Accessible-Moderate - Complex ideas made clear with precision

## Writing Principles

### Core Rules
1. **Patterns over metaphors** - Focus on mechanisms, not surface similarities
2. **Biology first, then transfer** - Ground in concrete biological examples before generalizing
3. **Systems thinking** - Show connections and trade-offs, not isolated phenomena
4. **Actionable insights** - Every pattern should enable better decisions

### Specific Guidelines for Defense/Healing Content
- **Structure**: Problem ‚Üí Biological mechanism ‚Üí Transfer principles ‚Üí Applications
- **Examples**: Start cellular/tissue, move to psychological, then organizational/societal
- **Trade-offs**: Always include the polarities and tensions (üåì sections)
- **Falsifiability**: Make predictions that could be wrong
- **Practical value**: End with concrete applications and practice prompts

### Avoid These Patterns
- ‚ùå Vague metaphors without mechanistic grounding
- ‚ùå "Like a..." without explaining the actual similarity
- ‚ùå Pattern claims without transfer criteria or failure modes
- ‚ùå Biological determinism or oversimplification
- ‚ùå Solutions without acknowledging trade-offs

## Chapter Structure Standards

### Opening Hook (Every Chapter)
- Start with: story, question, paradox, or striking fact
- Connect to chapter's core message within 200 words
- Make readers want to continue

### Section Flow
- **Build momentum**: Each section should feel essential
- **Maintain focus**: Don't chase interesting tangents  
- **Land insights**: End sections with clear takeaways, not summaries

### Chapter Conclusions
- **Synthesis**: Pull threads together, don't just recap
- **Bridge**: Set up the next chapter naturally
- **Resonance**: Leave readers with something memorable

## Quality Standards

### Every Chapter Must
- [ ] Advance the book's overall argument
