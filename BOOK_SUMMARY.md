# Defense & Healing Across Living Systems - Progress Dashboard

> **Last Updated**: 2025-08-29 | **Status**: All Chapters Drafted | **Progress**: 100% Draft Complete

## Project Overview
- **Title**: Defense & Healing Across Living Systems: A Pattern Language for Defense, Healing, and Resilience from Cells to Societies
- **Author**: DTP
- **Genre**: Non-fiction (Systems/Biology)
- **Target Length**: 100,000 words
- **Started**: 2025-08-29
- **Estimated Completion**: TBD based on review and revision pace

## Book Ambition

### Core Thesis
Living systems at all scales—from cells to societies—use remarkably similar patterns for defense and healing. These aren't metaphors but genuine mechanistic similarities arising from shared constraints. Understanding this "grammar of resilience" enables better design of human systems.

### Reader Transformation  
Readers will gain a systematic framework for recognizing resilience patterns across domains, transfer principles between scales thoughtfully, and design more robust systems by working with rather than against natural dynamics.

### Unique Value
First comprehensive mapping of defense/healing patterns across biological and social scales with rigorous transfer criteria. Bridges systems biology, cybernetics, and practical application with scientific grounding rather than loose metaphor.

## Thematic Threads

### Thread 1: Polarity Management
- **Chapters**: All pattern chapters (5-16)
- **Development**: Each pattern has core tension (🌓 sections) - building toward meta-framework for balancing trade-offs

### Thread 2: Scale Transfer Principles  
- **Chapters**: 2, 4, all patterns
- **Development**: From rigorous mechanism identification to validated transfer heuristics

### Thread 3: Information & Control Theory
- **Chapters**: 2, 6, 8, 9, 10
- **Development**: Cybernetic foundations → detection → feedback loops → system stability

### Thread 4: Evolutionary Design Principles
- **Chapters**: 14, 15, plus applications throughout
- **Development**: Why certain patterns persist, how to work with rather than against natural selection
